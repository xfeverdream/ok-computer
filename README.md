### Overview
ok computer is a **lightweight 2D game engine** focused on rapid development of *point-and-click experiences* with minimal dependencies and **minimal code**.
It is designed around a simple, explicit programming model that emphasizes clarity, control, and fast iteration. Rather than imposing complex workflows or heavy abstractions, ok computer provides a small, well-defined core that lets developers describe scenes, interactions, and state directly in the editor.
The engine scales naturally from small prototypes to larger narrative-driven projects without changing paradigms. The engine and game runtime remain compact.
ok computer targets developers who value transparency and long-term maintainability over convenience-driven automation, making it suitable for both experimentation and production use.
